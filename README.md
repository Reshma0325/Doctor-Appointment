# Objective
The project entitled "Doctor Appointment System" is a system designed to keep track of doctors and patients information. The purpose of the Doctor Appointment System is to automate the existing manual system with the help of computerised equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements, so that their valuable data or information can be stored for a longer period of time with easy accessing and manipulation of the same. A Doctor Appointment System can lead to an error-free, secure, reliable, and fast management system. It can help the user concentrate on their other activities rather than on record-keeping. Thus it will help organisation in  better  utilisation  of  resources. The organisation can maintain computerised records without redundant entries. That means one need not be distracted by information that is not relevant while being able to reach the information. The main function of the system is to register and store patient and doctor details, retrieve these details as and when required, and also manipulate these details meaningfully.
